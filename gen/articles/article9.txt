Chancellor Jennifer L. Mnookin on Monday toured the Schmidt family farm in Lone Rock, Wis., a 3,000-cow dairy operation that produces 330,000 pounds of milk daily. The family told her about their commitment to sustainable farming practices and the key role UW–Madison plays in the dairy industry in Wisconsin and beyond. Mnookin also visited UW–Platteville’s Pioneer Farm on Monday, highlighting UW–Madison’s Dairy Innovation Hub partnership with UW–Platteville and UW–River Falls.

The Dairy Innovation Hub receives $7.8 million from the state annually with the goal of conducting research and offering support to keep Wisconsin’s dairy community at the global forefront in producing nutritious dairy products in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable manner. In Wisconsin, 79,000 jobs are dairy farming or processing related, with 6,275 dairy farms that produce 31.7 billion pounds of milk.
