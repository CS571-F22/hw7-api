Since becoming the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s 30th leader on Aug. 4, Chancellor Jennifer L. Mnookin has made it a priority to learn more about the state, listening to the university’s many stakeholders about what the institution is doing well and what it can do better.

This week, Mnookin’s travels led her to northwestern Wisconsin, starting in Black River Falls and a meeting with Ho-Chunk Nation leadership, including President Marlon WhiteEagle. The group discussed shared priorities and UW–Madison’s commitment to providing greater access to Native American students.

The next stop was the Wisconsin Cranberry Research Station near Millston. The station is a private-public partnership with contributions from cranberry growers, cranberry businesses and the USDA-Agricultural Research Service, with UW­–Madison contributing $500,000 to support it. Wisconsin produces more than 60 percent of the nation’s cranberry crop, expected to exceed 500 million pounds this year.
